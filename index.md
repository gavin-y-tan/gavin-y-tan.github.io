# About Me
I am currently pursuing a BA in Computer Science at Boston University. I became interested in CS due to my interest in video games. My most familiar languages are C, C#, Python, and Java. In my freetime I enjoy playing for my school's Overwatch team and practicing martial arts.

## Projects
[Minecraft Plugins](https://github.com/gavin-y-tan/MinecraftPlugins)
-Custom plugins (in Java with the Bukkit/Spigot package), for the game Minecraft, that each implement different custom game modes. 


[Multiplayer FPS Prototype](https://github.com/gavin-y-tan/UnityGameTestFiles)
-Game prototype (with the Unity Engine and using C# for scripts), with the basic mechanics of a multiplayer first-person shooter. Current mechanics including: shooting with raycasts, player movement, camera movement, objectives, UI, and LAN networking (using the Unity networking API, Mirror).
